## Data & Backend

- ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ReactiveX/rxdart?style=social) [RxDart](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxdart) - RxDart extends the capabilities of Dart Streams and StreamControllers.

  Dart comes with a very decent Streams API out-of-the-box; rather than attempting to provide an alternative to this API, RxDart adds functionality from the reactive extensions specification on top of it.

  RxDart does not provide its Observable class as a replacement for Dart Streams. Instead, it offers several additional Stream classes, operators (extension methods on the Stream class), and Subjects.

  If you are familiar with Observables from other languages, please see the [Rx Observables vs. Dart Streams comparison chart](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxdart#rx-observables-vs-dart-streams) for notable distinctions between the two.
- <img width="24" alt="flutter_favorite_badge" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1112181/109502339-d11da080-7ad3-11eb-8324-e2aaba817f16.png"> Google! [json_serializable](https://github.com/google/json_serializable.dart/tree/master/json_serializable) - Provides Dart Build System builders for handling JSON.
  The builders generate code when they find members annotated with classes defined in package:json_annotation.

  To generate to/from JSON code for a class, annotate it with JsonSerializable. You can provide arguments to JsonSerializable to configure the generated code. You can also customize individual fields by annotating them with JsonKey and providing custom arguments. See the table below for details on the annotation values.

  To generate a Dart field with the contents of a file containing JSON, use the JsonLiteral annotation.

- ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/k-paxian/dart-json-mapper?style=social) [dart_json_mapper](https://github.com/k-paxian/dart-json-mapper) - This package allows programmers to annotate Dart objects in order to Serialize / Deserialize them to / from JSON.

  Flexible: Drift let's you write queries in both SQL and Dart, providing fluent apis for both languages. You can filter and order results or use joins to run queries on multiple tables. You can even use complex sql features like WITH and WINDOW clauses.

- üî• Feature rich: Drift has builtin support for transactions, schema migrations, complex filters and expressions, batched updates and joins. We even have a builtin IDE for SQL!
- üì¶ Modular: Thanks to builtin support for daos and imports in sql files, drift helps you keep your database code simple.
- üõ°Ô∏è Safe: Drift generates typesafe code based on your tables and queries. If you make a mistake in your queries, drift will find it at compile time and provide helpful and descriptive lints.
- ‚ö° Fast: Even though drift lets you write powerful queries, it can keep up with the performance of key-value stores like shared preferences and Hive. Drift is the only major persistence library with builtin threading support, allowing you to run database code across isolates with zero additional effort.
Reactive: Turn any sql query into an auto-updating stream! This includes complex queries across many tables
- ‚öôÔ∏è Cross-Platform support: Drift works on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux and the web. This template is a Flutter todo app that works on all platforms.
- üó°Ô∏è Battle tested and production ready: Drift is stable and well tested with a wide range of unit and integration tests. It powers production Flutter apps.
With drift, persistence on Flutter is fun!

  By using provider instead of manually writing InheritedWidget, you get:
  - simplified allocation/disposal of resources
  - lazy-loading
  - a vastly reduced boilerplate over making a new class every time
  - devtool friendly ‚Äì using Provider, the state of your application will be visible in the Flutter devtool
  - a common way to consume these InheritedWidgets (See Provider.of/Consumer/Selector)
  - increased scalability for classes with a listening mechanism that grows exponentially in complexity (such as ChangeNotifier, which is O(N) for dispatching notifications).
- ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/rrousselGit/riverpod?style=social) [river_pod](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod) - A state-management library that:
  - catches programming errors at compile time rather than at runtime
  - removes nesting for listening/combining objects
  - ensures that the code is testable

  This project can be considered as a rewrite of provider to make improvements that would be otherwise impossible.

This wiring is completely automatic and feels very natural. As the application-developer, you focus purely on what reactive-data needs to be consumed in the UI (and elsewhere) without worrying about keeping the two in sync.

  It's not really magic but it does have some smarts around what is being consumed (observables) and where (reactions), and automatically tracks it for you. When the observables change, all reactions are re-run. What's interesting is that these reactions can be anything from a simple console log, a network call to re-rendering the UI.

  > MobX has been a very effective library for the JavaScript apps and this port to the Dart language aims to bring the same levels of productivity.

Using Freezed, we will get:

  - a simple and concise syntax for defining models, where we don't need to define both a constructor and a property.
Instead, we only need to define the constructor, removing unnecessary duplication.

  - a copyWith method, for cloning objects with different values.
Note: As opposed to many alternatives, when using Freezed, that copyWith method correctly supports assigning null to a value.

  - union-types/pattern matching, for making impossible states impossible. See also unions/sealed-classes.

  - an automatic serialization/deserialization of your objects (including union types).

  - a default ==/toString implementation which respectively compares/shows all properties of the object.

  See [the example](https://github.com/rrousselGit/freezed/blob/master/packages/freezed/example/lib/main.dart) for a preview on what's available

  - Immutable value types;
  - EnumClass, classes that behave like enums;
  - JSON serialization.
  - Immutable collections are from built_collection.

  See the API docs.

- ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dart-lang/build?style=social) [Dart Official Build](https://github.com/dart-lang/build) - These packages provide libraries for generating, compiling and serving Dart code.
  - build: Defines the interfaces for creating a Builder which is a way of doing codegen that is compatible across build systems (pub, bazel, standalone runner).

    For packages doing code generation this should generally be the only package against which there is a public dependency. Packages may have a dev_dependency on one or more of the other packages.

  - build_config: Support for parsing build.yaml files. Used by build_runner.
  - build_modules: Support for discovering the sub-modules within packages and creating summaries of those modules. Used by build_web_compilers but should not be used directly by most users.
  - build_resolvers: An implementation of the Resolver interface to use the analyzer during build steps.
  - build_runner: Provides utilities to enact builds and a way to automatically run builds based on configuration.

    This package should generally be a dev_dependency as it is used to run standalone builds. The only exception would be wrapping the build and watch methods with some other package.
  - build_test: Stub implementations for classes in Build and some utilities for running instances of builds and checking their outputs.

    This package generally only be a dev_dependency as it introduces a dependency on package:test. The exception to that would be if you were creating another testing-only package that wraps this one.
  - build_web_compilers: Provides the dart2js and dartdevc support for your package. To use this package you should add it as a dev_dependency.

    If you are using the automated build scripts, your project will automatically start being compiled with dartdevc, and you can start developing with chrome without any configuration.

- ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dart-lang/source_gen?style=social) [dart-lang/source_gen](https://github.com/dart-lang/source_gen) - source_gen provides utilities for automated source code generation for Dart:
  - A framework for writing Builders that consume and produce Dart code.
  - A convention for human and tool generated Dart code to coexist with clean separation, and for multiple code generators to integrate in the same project.

  Its main purpose is to expose a developer-friendly API on top of lower-level packages like the analyzer or build. You don't have to use source_gen in order to generate source code; we also expose a set of library APIs that might be useful in your generators.

## Desktop Only

- ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/google/flutter-desktop-embedding?style=social) [flutter-desktop-embedding](https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding/) - This project was originally created to develop Windows, macOS, and Linux embeddings of Flutter. That work has since become part of Flutter, and all that remains here are experimental, early-stage desktop plugins.

  If you want to get started with Flutter on desktop, the place to start is now the Flutter documentation, rather than this project. You will already need to have followed the instructions there to get an application running on desktop before using any of the plugins here.

  - [menubar](https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding/tree/main/plugins/menubar) - This plugin provides access to a native menubar.

    This is a prototype, and in the long term will either be replaced by functionality within the Flutter framework itself, or a published plugin (likely part of flutter/plugins). Either way, the API will change significantly.
  - [window_size](https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding/tree/main/plugins/window_size) - This plugin allows resizing and repositioning the window containing the Flutter content, as well as querying screen information.

    This is a prototype, and in the long term is expected to be replaced by [functionality within the Flutter framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11_4wntz_9IJTQOo_Qhp7QF4RfpIMTfVygtOTxQ4OGHY/edit).
